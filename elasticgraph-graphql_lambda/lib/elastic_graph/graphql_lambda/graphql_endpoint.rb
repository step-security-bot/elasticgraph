      # Used to add a timeout buffer so that the lambda timeout should generally not be reached,
      # instead preferring our `timeout_in_ms` behavior to the harsher timeout imposed by lambda itself.
      # We prefer this in order to have consistent timeout behavior, regardless of what timeout is
      # reached. For example, we have designed our timeout logic to disconnect from the datastore
      # (which causes it to kill the running query) but we do not know if the lambda-based timeout
      # would also cause that. This buffer gives our lambda enough time to respond before the hard
      # lambda timeout so that it should (hopefully) never get reached.
      #
      # Note we generally run with a 30 second overall lambda timeout so a single second of buffer
      # still gives plenty of time to satisfy the query.

      # > _GraphQL field error_ raised.
      # >
      # > Note: A status code in the `4xx` or `5xx` ranges or status code `203` (and maybe
      # > others) could originate from intermediary servers; since the client cannot
      # > determine if an `application/json` response with arbitrary status code is a
      # > well-formed _GraphQL response_ (because it cannot trust the source) the server
      # > must use `200` status code to guarantee to the client that the response has not
      # > been generated or modified by an intermediary.
      # >
      # > ...
      # > The server SHOULD NOT use a `4xx` or `5xx` status code for a response to a
      # > well-formed _GraphQL-over-HTTP request_.
      # >
      # > Note: For compatibility with legacy servers, this specification allows the use
      # > of `4xx` or `5xx` status codes for a failed well-formed _GraphQL-over-HTTP
      # > request_ where the response uses the `application/json` media type, but it is
      # > strongly discouraged. To use `4xx` and `5xx` status codes in these situations,
      # > please use the `application/graphql-response+json` media type.

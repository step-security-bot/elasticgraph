# ElasticGraph::Apollo

Implements the [Apollo Federation Subgraph Spec](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraph-spec/),
allowing an ElasticGraph application to be plugged into an Apollo-powered GraphQL server as a subgraph.

Note: this library only supports the v2 Federation specification.

## Usage

First, add `elasticgraph-apollo` to your `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
gem "elasticgraph-apollo"
```

Finally, update your ElasticGraph schema artifact rake tasks in your `Rakefile`
so that `ElasticGraph::GraphQL::Apollo::SchemaDefinition::APIExtension` is
passed as one of the `extension_modules`:

``` ruby
require "elastic_graph/schema_definition/rake_tasks"
require "elastic_graph/apollo/schema_definition/api_extension"

ElasticGraph::SchemaDefinition::RakeTasks.new(
  schema_element_name_form: :snake_case,
  index_document_sizes: true,
  path_to_schema: "config/schema.rb",
  schema_artifacts_directory: artifacts_dir,
  extension_modules: [ElasticGraph::Apollo::SchemaDefinition::APIExtension]
)
```

That's it!

## Federation Version Support

This library supports multiple versions of Apollo federation. As of Jan. 2024, it supports:

* v2.0
* v2.3
* v2.5
* v2.6

By default, the newest version is targeted. If you need an older version (e.g. because your organization is
running an older Apollo version), you can configure it in your schema definition with:

```ruby
schema.target_apollo_federation_version "2.3"
```

## Testing Notes

This project uses https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-federation-subgraph-compatibility
to verify compatibility with Apollo. Things to note:

- Run `elasticgraph-apollo/script/test_compatibility` to run the compatibility tests (the CI build runs this).
- Run `elasticgraph-apollo/script/boot_eg_apollo_implementation` to boot the ElasticGraph compatibility test implementation (can be useful for debugging `test_compatibility` failures).
- These scripts require some additional dependencies to be installed (such as `docker`, `node`, and `npm`).
- To get that to pass locally on my Mac, I had to enable the `Use Docker Compose V2` flag in Docker Desktop (under "Preferences -> General").  Without that checked, I got errors like this:

```

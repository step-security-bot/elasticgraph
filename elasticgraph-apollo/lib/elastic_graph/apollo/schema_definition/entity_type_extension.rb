      # The Apollo `_Entity` type is a type union of _all_ entity subtypes in an ElasticGraph schema.
      # However, unlike a normal union type:
      #
      # - `_Entity` is never an indexed type, and should not be treated as one (even though its subtypes are all indexed, which would
      #   usually cause it to be treated as indexed!).
      # - A merged set of `graphql_fields_by_name` cannot be safely computed. That method raises errors if a field with the same name
      #   has conflicting definitions on different subtypes, but we must allow that on `_Entity` subtypes.

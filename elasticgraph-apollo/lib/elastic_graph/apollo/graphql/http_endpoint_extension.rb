      # https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/metrics/
      #
      # Luckily, the apollo-federation gem supports this--we just need to:
      #
      # 1. Use the `ApolloFederation::Tracing` plugin (implemented via `EngineExtension#graphql_gem_plugins`).
      # 2. Conditionally pass `tracing_enabled: true` into in `context`.
      #
      # This extension handles the latter requirement. For more info, see:

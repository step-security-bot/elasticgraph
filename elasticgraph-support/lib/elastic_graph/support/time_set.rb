    # Models a set of `::Time` objects, but does so using one or more `::Range` objects.
    # This is done so that we can support unbounded sets (such as "all times after midnight
    # on date X").
    #
    # Internally, this is a simple wrapper around a set of `::Range` objects. Those ranges take
    # a few different forms:
    #
    # - ALL: a range with no bounds, which implicitly contains all `::Time`s. (It's like the
    #   integer set from negative to positive infinity).
    # - An open range: a range with only an upper or lower bound (but not the other).
    # - A closed range: a range with an upper and lower bound.
    # - An empty range: a range that contains no `::Time`s, by virtue of its bounds having no overlap.

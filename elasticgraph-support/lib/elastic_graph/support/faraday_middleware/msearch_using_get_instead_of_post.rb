    module FaradayMiddleware
      # Custom Faraday middleware that forces `msearch` calls to use an HTTP GET instead of an HTTP POST. While not
      # necessary, it preserves a useful property: all "read" calls made by ElasticGraph use an HTTP GET, and HTTP POST
      # requests are "write" calls. This allows the access policy to only grant HTTP GET access from the GraphQL endpoint,
      # which leads to a more secure setup (as the GraphQL endpoint can be blocked from performing any writes).
      #
      # Note: before elasticsearch-ruby 7.9.0, `msearch` used an HTTP GET request, so this simply restores that behavior.
      # This results in an HTTP GET with a request body, but it works just fine and its what the Ruby Elasticsearch client
      # did for years.
      #
      # For more info, see: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/issues/1005

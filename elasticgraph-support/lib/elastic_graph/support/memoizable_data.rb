    # `::Data.define` in Ruby 3.2+ is *very* handy for defining immutable value objects. However, one annoying
    # aspect: instances are frozen, which gets in the way of defining a memoized method (e.g. a method that
    # caches the result of an expensive computation). While memoization is not always safe (e.g. if you rely
    # on an impure side-effect...) it's safe if what you're memoizing is a pure function of the immutable state
    # of the value object. We rely on that very heavily in ElasticGraph (and used it with a prior "value objects"
    # library we use before upgrading to Ruby 3.2).
    #
    # This abstraction aims to behave just like `::Data.define`, but with the added ability to define memoized methods.
    # It makes this possible by combining `::Data.define` with `SimpleDelegator`: that defines a data class, but then
    # wraps instances of it in a `SimpleDelegator` instance which is _not_ frozen. The memoized methods can then be
    # defined on the wrapper.
    #
    # Note: getting this code to typecheck with steep is quite difficult, so we're just skipping it.

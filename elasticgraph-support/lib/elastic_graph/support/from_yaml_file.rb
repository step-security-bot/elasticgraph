      # This is designed for a `RakeTasks` class that needs an ElasticGraph component (e.g. an
      # `ElasticGraph::GraphQL`, `ElasticGraph::Admin`, or `ElasticGraph::Indexer` instance).
      # When the schema artifacts are out of date, loading those components can fail. This gracefully
      # handles that for you, giving you clear instructions of what to do when this happens.

      # so that it happens lazily.

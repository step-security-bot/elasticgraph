      # Like Enumerable#map, but performs the map in parallel using one thread per list item.
      # Exceptions that happen in the threads will propagate to the caller at the end.
      # Due to Ruby's GVL, this will never be helpful for pure computation, but can be
      # quite helpful when dealing with blocking I/O. However, the cost of threads is
      # such that this method should not be used when you have a large list of items to
      # map over (say, hundreds or thousands of items or more).

          ::Thread.new do
            # Disable reporting of exceptions. We use `value` at the end of this method, which
            # propagates any exception that happened in the thread to the calling thread. If
            # this is true (the default), then the exception is also printed to $stderr which
            # is quite noisy.

        # whatever exception happened in the thread. `join` doesn't propagate the exception in
        # the same way, so we always want to use `Thread#value` even if we are just using threads
        # for side effects.

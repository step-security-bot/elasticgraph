      # Simple helper function to convert a local time string (such as `03:45:12` or `12:30:43.756`)
      # to an integer value between 0 and 24 * 60 * 60 * 1,000,000,000 - 1 representing the nano of day
      # for the local time value.
      #
      # This is meant to match the behavior of Java's `LocalTime#toNanoOfDay()` API:
      # https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/LocalTime.html#toNanoOfDay()
      #
      # This is specifically useful when we need to work with local time values in a script: by converting
      # a local time parameter to nano-of-day, our script can more efficiently compare values, avoiding the
      # need to parse the same local time parameters over and over again as it applies the script to each
      # document.
      #
      # Note: this method assumes the given `local_time_string` is well-formed. You'll get an exception if
      # you provide a malformed value, but no effort has been put into giving a clear error message. The
      # caller is expected to have already validated that the `local_time_string` is formatted correctly.

# This file is contains RSpec configuration and common support code for `elasticgraph-support`.
# Note that it gets loaded by `spec_support/spec_helper.rb` which contains common spec support
# code for all ElasticGraph test suites.

# Here we load the version file so that it gets covered. When running the test suite without using bundler (e.g. after setting
# things up with `bundler --standalone`) the version file will not be pre-loaded from the gemspec like it usually is when run
# through bundler so we need to load it for it to be covered.

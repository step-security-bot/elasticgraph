  # restarting the datastore to fix the issue, specs continued to fail with the

  # it back on a later test run. This led us to scratch our heads and waste time.

  # To avoid this situation, we want to entirely avoid recording when an example
  # fails, as there is no significant benefit to doing so. Note that this line

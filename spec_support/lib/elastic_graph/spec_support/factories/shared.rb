# activesupport 7.2.0 was recently (2024-08-09) released and broke factory_bot.
# To work around it we need to require it here, as per:
# https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/issues/1685
#
# TODO: once factory_bot has had a new release with a fix, remove this require (we don't use activesupport).

    # Our various parallel spec runner adapters need to be hook into other classes in order to patch how they work to be compatible
    # with running concurrently at the same time as specs in another worker process. However, we support running our tests in multiple
    # ways, including in the context of a single gem's bundle. When running in a single gem's bundle, some dependencies may be unavailable
    # (it depends on what's in the gem's `gemspec` file). In that case, a require performed from one or more of these adapters may fail
    # with a `LoadError`. But that's OK: if a given dependency is not available, then it's not being used and we don't have to patch it!
    # So we can safely ignore it.

    # for a couple reasons:
    #
    # 1. This makes it deterministic. Our parallel test runner distributes the spec files across all workers based on the recorded runtimes
    #    of the specs (to try and balance them). This process is inherently non-deterministic, and can lead to "flickering" situations where
    #    a unit spec that uses `instance_double` is run with an acceptance spec on one run and not on the next run even though the entire
    #    suite is being run.
    # 2. We generally only use the parallel spec runner when running the entire suite (or at least the entire suite of a single gem), so
    #    we are already in a context when we're loading most or all things.

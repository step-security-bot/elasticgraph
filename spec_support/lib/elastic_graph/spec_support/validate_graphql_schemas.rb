# During the upgrade of the GraphQL gem from version 2.0.15 to 2.0.16, we discovered that
# some of the schemas generated in our tests were not parseable by the GraphQL gem. Allowing
# invalid GraphQL schemas can hide latent issues (or lead to issues later on when we are forced
# to correct it) so we'd like to prevent invalid schemas from being generated in the first place.
#
# Here we define a method that uses the GraphQL gem to enforce the validity of our generated
# schemas. However, parsing all our test schemas makes our tests 2-3 times slower. We don't
# want to slow down every local test run to add this validation, so it's something that you can
# opt in to via the `VALIDATE_GRAPHQL_SCHEMAS` env var. We also pass this env var from our CI
# build where it's ok if the test suite is slower.
#
# :nocov: -- only one of the two branches gets run on any test run.

        This test generated SDL that can't be parsed by the GraphQL gem. The error[^1] is shown below.
        Note that the extra GraphQL gem parsing validation is not applied by default when you run tests locally.
        The extra validation runs on CI (where we are OK with the slow down that produces), and you can opt into
        it by passing `VALIDATE_GRAPHQL_SCHEMAS=1` when running your tests.

# Our test suite does _a ton_ of GraphQL parsing, given that `ElasticGraph::GraphQL`
# is instantated from scratch in virtually every `elasticgraph-graphql` test, and the GraphQL schema gets re-parsed
# each time. Using `profiling.rb` we've found that GraphQL parsing takes up a significant portion
# of our test suite runtime. Here we optimize it by simply memoizing the results of parsing a
# GraphQL string (which applies to both schema definitions and GraphQL queries). The GraphQL
# gem provides a nice `GraphQL.default_parser` API we can use to plug in our own parser, which just
# wraps the built-in one with memoization.

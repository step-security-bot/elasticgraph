  # With the release of logger 1.6.0, and the release of faraday 2.10.0 (which depends on the `logger` gem for the first time),
  # it was discovered during a failed deploy that the AWS lambda Ruby runtime breaks logger 1.6.0 due to how it monkey patches it!
  # This caught us off guard since our CI build didn't fail with the same kind of error.
  #
  # We've fixed it by pinning logger < 1.6.0. To prevent a regression, and to identify future incompatibilities, here we load the
  # AWS Lambda Ruby runtime and install its monkey patches. We observed that this lead to the same kind of error as we saw during
  # the failed deploy before we pinned the logger version.

    # included. However, our existing test suite alone isn't sufficient to guard
    # against this, for a couple reasons:
    #
    #   1) Most of our indices have only 1 shard, in which case the routing value
    #      effectively has no impact on search behavior, as all routing values (or
    #      none!) would route to the one and only shard.

    # adds an assertion to every test that uses the datastore that `routing` was not used on

        #{"=" * 100}
        Your test run had #{result.missed_lines} lines and #{result.missed_branches} code branches that were not covered by the executed tests.
        We do not have a goal of 100% test coverage in ElasticGraph; however, we do have the goal of having
        all uncovered code explicitly labeled as such with `# :nocov:` so that it is easy to tell at a
        glance what code is uncovered by tests. And we do want a high level of test coverage; Ruby's dynamic
        nature means that misspelled variables, method names, etc can usually only be detected at run time, meaning
        that every uncovered line of code is a line that our CI build may not be able to detect a breakage in.

        See the table above to see detailed coverage information.  For each bit of uncovered code, do one of the following:

        1) Delete it. If the code is "dead code" (such as a private method that no longer has any callers),
           just delete it!

        2) Add test coverage. (This might require refactoring the code to make it more testable).

        3) Surround the code with `# :nocov:` comments (on the lines before and after) to mark it as a known
           uncovered bit of code. This should only be done for code that you have determined would cost more
           to test than the value we would get from the tests. For example, this is sometimes the case for
           code that only ever runs locally (e.g. in a rake task) that interacts heavily with the environment.
           Note: if you add a `# :nocov:` comment, please leave an explanation for why the code is not being
           covered.

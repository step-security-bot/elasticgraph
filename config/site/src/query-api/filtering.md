Use `filter:` on a root query field to narrow down the returned results:

{% highlight graphql %}
{{ site.data.music_queries.filtering.FindArtist }}
{% endhighlight %}

As shown here, filters have two basic parts:

* A _field path_: this specifies which field you want to filter on. When dealing with a nested field (e.g. `bio.yearFormed`),
  you'll need to provide a nested object matching the field structure.
* A _filtering predicate_: this specifies a filtering operator to apply at the field path.

### Ignored Filters

Filters with a value of `null` or empty object (`{}`) are ignored. The filters in this query are all ignored:

{% highlight graphql %}
{{ site.data.music_queries.filtering.IgnoredFilters }}
{% endhighlight %}

This particularly comes in handy when using [query variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables).
It allows a query to flexibly support a wide array of filters without requiring them to all be used for an
individual request.

{% highlight graphql %}
{{ site.data.music_queries.filtering.FindArtists }}
{% endhighlight %}

{% include subpages.html %}

        # specified in our configuration settings (e.g. via `setting_overrides_by_timestamp` and
        # `custom_time_sets`) and also indices that have been auto-created from the template.
        #
        # Note that there can be discrepancies between the configuration settings and the indices in
        # the datastore. Sometimes this is planned/expected (e.g. such as when invoking `elasticgraph-admin`
        # to configure an index newly defined in configuration) and in other cases it's not.
        #
        # The `only_if_exists` argument controls how a discrepancy is treated.
        #
        # - When `false` (the default), indices that are defined in config but do not exist in the datastore are still returned.
        #   This is generally what we want for indexing and cluster administration.
        # - When `true`, any indices in our configuration that do not exist are ignored, and not included in the returned list.
        #   This is appropriate for searching the datastore: if we attempt to exclude an index which is defined in config but does
        #   not exist (e.g. via `-[index_name]` in the search index expression), the datastore will return an error, but we can
        #   safely ignore the index. Likewise, if we have an index in the datastore which we cannot infer a timestamp range, we
        #   need to ignore it to avoid getting errors. Ignoring an index is safe when searching because our search logic uses a
        #   wildcard to match _all_ indices with the same prefix, and then excludes certain known indices that it can safely
        #   exclude based on their timestamp range. Ignored indices which exist will still be searched.
        #
        # In addition, any indices which exist, but which are not controlled by our current configuration, are ignored. Examples:
        #
        #  - An index with a custom suffix (e.g. `__before_2019`) which has no corresponding configuration. We have no way to guess
        #    what the timestamp range is for such an index, and we want to completely ignore it.
        #  - An index with for a different rollover frequency than our current configuration. For example, a `__2019-03` index,
        #    which must rollover monthly, would be ignored if our current rollover frequency is yearly or daily.
        #
        # These latter cases are quite rare but can happen when we are dealing with indices defined before an update to our
        # configuration. Our searches will continue to search these indices so long as their name matches the pattern, and
        # we otherwise want to ignore these indices (e.g. we don't want admin to attempt to configure them, or want our
        # indexer to attempt to write to them).

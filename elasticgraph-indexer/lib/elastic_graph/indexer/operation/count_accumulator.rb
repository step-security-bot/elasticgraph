module ElasticGraph
  class Indexer
    module Operation
      # Responsible for maintaining state and accumulating list counts while we traverse the `data` we are preparing
      # to update in the index. Much of the complexity here is due to the fact that we have 3 kinds of list fields:
      # scalar lists, embedded object lists, and `nested` object lists.
      #
      # The Elasticsearch/OpenSearch `nested` type[^1] indexes objects of this type as separate hidden documents. As a result,
      # each `nested` object type gets its own `__counts` field. In contrast, embedded object lists get flattened into separate
      # entries (one per field path) in a flat map (with `dot_separated_path: values_at_path` entries) at the document root.
      #
      # We mirror this structure with our `__counts`: each document (either a root document, or a hidden `nested` document)
      # gets its own `__counts` field, so we essentially have multiple "count parents". Each `__counts` field is a map,
      # keyed by field paths, and containing the number of list elements at that field path after the flattening has
      # occurred.
      #
      # The index mapping defines where the `__counts` fields go. This abstraction uses the mapping to determine when
      # it needs to create a new "count parent".
      #
      # Note: instances of this class are "shallow immutable" (none of the attributes of an instance can be reassigned)
      # but the `counts` attribute is itself a mutable hash--we use it to accumulate the list counts as we traverse the
      # structure.

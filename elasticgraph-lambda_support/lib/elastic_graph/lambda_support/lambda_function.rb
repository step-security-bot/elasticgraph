  module LambdaSupport
    # Mixin that can be used to define a lambda function, with common cross-cutting concerns
    # handled automatically for you:
    #
    #   - The amount of time it takes to boot the lambda is logged.
    #   - An error handling hook is provided which applies both to boot-time logic and request handling.
    #
    # It is designed to be prepending onto a class, like so:
    #
    # class DoSomething
    #   prepend LambdaFunction
    #
    #   def initialize
    #     require 'my_application'
    #     @application = MyApplication.new(ENV[...])
    #   end
    #
    #   def handle_request(event:, context:)
    #     @application.handle_request(event: event, context: context)
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # Using `prepend` is necessary so that it can wrap `initialize` and `handle_request` with error handling.
    # It is recommended that `require`s be put in `initialize` instead of at the top of the lambda function
    # file so that the error handler can handle any errors that happen while loading dependencies.
    #
    # `handle_exceptions` can also be overridden in order to provide error handling.

module ElasticGraph
  module SchemaArtifacts
    module RuntimeMetadata
      # Represents an extension--a class or module (potentially from outside the ElasticGraph
      # code base) that implements a standard interface to plug in custom functionality.
      #
      # Extensions are serialized using two fields:
      # - `extension_name`: the Ruby constant of the extension
      # - `require_path`: file path to `require` to load the extension
      #
      # However, an `Extension` instance represents a loaded, resolved extension.
      # We eagerly load extensions (and validate them in the `ExtensionLoader`) in
      # order to surface any issues with the extension as soon as possible. We don't
      # want to defer errors if we can detect any issues with the extension at boot time.
      Extension = ::Data.define(:extension_class, :require_path, :extension_config) do
        # @implements Extension

        # Loads an extension using a serialized hash, via the provided `ExtensionLoader`.

          config = Support::HashUtil.symbolize_keys(hash["extension_config"] || {}) # : ::Hash[::Symbol, untyped]
          via.load(hash.fetch("extension_name"), from: hash.fetch("require_path"), config: config)
        end

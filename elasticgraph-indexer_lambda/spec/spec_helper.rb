  # The aws-sdk-s3 gem requires that an XML library be available on the load path. Before we upgraded to
  # Ruby 3, that requirement was satisfied by rexml from the standard library. In Ruby 3, it's been moved
  # out of the standard library (into a bundled gem), which means that it isn't automatically available.
  # However, `rexml` is a transitive dependency of some of the other gems of our bundle (rubocop, webmock)
  # and it therefore winds up on our load path. Its presence on the load path allowed our tests to pass
  # but failures to occur in production (where rexml was no longer available after we upgraded to Ruby 3.x).
  #
  # To reproduce that production issue, we want to remove rexml from the load path here. However, we can only
  # do so if this spec run is limited to spec files from this gem's spec suite. If any spec files are being
  # run from other gems (e.g. for the entire ElasticGraph test suite) we must leave it on the load path so
  # that it's available for the other things that need it.
  #
  # Our CI build runs each gem's test suite individually and also runs the entire test suite all together so
  # this should still guard against a regression even though the "standard" way we run our tests (e.g. the
  # entire test suite) won't benefit from this.
  #
  # :nocov: -- on any given test run only one side of this conditional is covered.

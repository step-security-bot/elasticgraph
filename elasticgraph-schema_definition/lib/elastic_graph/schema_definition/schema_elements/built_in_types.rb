module ElasticGraph
  module SchemaDefinition
    module SchemaElements
      # Defines all built-in GraphQL types provided by ElasticGraph.
      #
      # ## Scalar Types
      #
      # ### Standard GraphQL Scalars
      #
      # These are defined by the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Scalars.Built-in-Scalars).
      #
      # Boolean
      # : Represents `true` or `false` values.
      #
      # Float
      # : Represents signed double-precision fractional values as specified by
      #   [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point).
      #
      # ID
      # : Represents a unique identifier that is Base64 obfuscated. It is often used to
      #   refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a
      #   String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input
      #   type, any string (such as `"VXNlci0xMA=="`) or integer (such as `4`) input value will
      #   be accepted as an ID.
      #
      # Int
      # : Represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between
      #   -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1.
      #
      # String
      # : Represents textual data as UTF-8 character sequences. This type is most often used by
      #   GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.
      #
      # ### Additional ElasticGraph Scalars
      #
      # ElasticGraph defines these additional scalar types.
      #
      # Cursor
      # : An opaque string value representing a specific location in a paginated connection type.
      #   Returned cursors can be passed back in the next query via the `before` or `after`
      #   arguments to continue paginating from that point.
      #
      # Date
      # : A date, represented as an [ISO 8601 date string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).
      #
      # DateTime
      # : A timestamp, represented as an [ISO 8601 time string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).
      #
      # JsonSafeLong
      # : A numeric type for large integer values that can serialize safely as JSON. While JSON
      #   itself has no hard limit on the size of integers, the RFC-7159 spec mentions that
      #   values outside of the range -9,007,199,254,740,991 (-(2^53) + 1) to 9,007,199,254,740,991
      #   (2^53 - 1) may not be interopable with all JSON implementations. As it turns out, the
      #   number implementation used by JavaScript has this issue. When you parse a JSON string that
      #   contains a numeric value like `4693522397653681111`, the parsed result will contain a
      #   rounded value like `4693522397653681000`. While this is entirely a client-side problem,
      #   we want to preserve maximum compatibility with common client languages. Given the ubiquity
      #   of GraphiQL as a GraphQL client, we want to avoid this problem. Our solution is to support
      #   two separate types:
      #
      #   - This type (`JsonSafeLong`) is serialized as a number, but limits values to the safely
      #     serializable range.
      #   - The `LongString` type supports long values that use all 64 bits, but serializes as a
      #     string rather than a number, avoiding the JavaScript compatibility problems. For more
      #     background, see the [JavaScript `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`
      #     docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
      #
      # LocalTime
      # : A local time such as `"23:59:33"` or `"07:20:47.454"` without a time zone or offset,
      #   formatted based on the [partial-time portion of
      #   RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).
      #
      # LongString
      # : A numeric type for large integer values in the inclusive range -2^63 (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808)
      #   to (2^63 - 1) (9,223,372,036,854,775,807). Note that `LongString` values are serialized as strings
      #   within JSON, to avoid interopability problems with JavaScript. If you want a large integer type
      #   that serializes within JSON as a number, use `JsonSafeLong`.
      #
      # TimeZone
      # : An [IANA time zone identifier](https://www.iana.org/time-zones), such as `America/Los_Angeles`
      #   or `UTC`. For a full list of valid identifiers, see the
      #   [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List).
      #
      # Untyped
      # : A custom scalar type that allows any type of data, including:
      #
      #   - strings
      #   - numbers
      #   - objects and arrays (nested as deeply as you like)
      #   - booleans
      #
      #   Note: fields of this type are effectively untyped. We recommend it only be used for parts
      #   of your schema that can't be statically typed.
      #
      # ## Enum Types
      #
      # ElasticGraph defines these enum types. Most of these are intended for usage as an _input_
      # argument, but they could be used as a return type in your schema if they meet your needs.
      #
      # DateGroupingGranularity
      # : Enumerates the supported granularities of a `Date`.
      #
      # DateGroupingTruncationUnit
      # : Enumerates the supported truncation units of a `Date`.
      #
      # DateTimeGroupingGranularity
      # : Enumerates the supported granularities of a `DateTime`.
      #
      # DateTimeGroupingTruncationUnit
      # : Enumerates the supported truncation units of a `DateTime`.
      #
      # DateTimeUnit
      # : Enumeration of `DateTime` units.
      #
      # DateUnit
      # : Enumeration of `Date` units.
      #
      # DayOfWeek
      # : Indicates the specific day of the week.
      #
      # DistanceUnit
      # : Enumerates the supported distance units.
      #
      # LocalTimeGroupingTruncationUnit
      # : Enumerates the supported truncation units of a `LocalTime`.
      #
      # LocalTimeUnit
      # : Enumeration of `LocalTime` units.
      #
      # MatchesQueryAllowedEditsPerTerm
      # : Enumeration of allowed values for the `matchesQuery: {allowedEditsPerTerm: ...}` filter option.
      #
      # ## Object Types
      #
      # ElasticGraph defines these object types.
      #
      # AggregationCountDetail
      # : Provides detail about an aggregation `count`.
      #
      # GeoLocation
      # : Geographic coordinates representing a location on the Earth's surface.
      #
      # PageInfo
      # : Provides information about the specific fetched page. This implements the
      #   `PageInfo` specification from the [Relay GraphQL Cursor Connections
      #   Specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm#sec-undefined.PageInfo).

            t.documentation <<~EOS
              A numeric type for large integer values that can serialize safely as JSON.

              While JSON itself has no hard limit on the size of integers, the RFC-7159 spec
              mentions that values outside of the range #{format_number(JSON_SAFE_LONG_MIN)} (-(2^53) + 1)
              to #{format_number(JSON_SAFE_LONG_MAX)} (2^53 - 1) may not be interopable with all JSON
              implementations. As it turns out, the number implementation used by JavaScript
              has this issue. When you parse a JSON string that contains a numeric value like
              `4693522397653681111`, the parsed result will contain a rounded value like
              `4693522397653681000`.

              While this is entirely a client-side problem, we want to preserve maximum compatibility
              with common client languages. Given the ubiquity of GraphiQL as a GraphQL client,
              we want to avoid this problem.

              Our solution is to support two separate types:

              - This type (`JsonSafeLong`) is serialized as a number, but limits values to the safely
                serializable range.
              - The `LongString` type supports long values that use all 64 bits, but serializes as a
                string rather than a number, avoiding the JavaScript compatibility problems.

              For more background, see the [JavaScript `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`
              docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).

              interopability problems with JavaScript. If you want a large integer type that
              serializes within JSON as a number, use `JsonSafeLong`.

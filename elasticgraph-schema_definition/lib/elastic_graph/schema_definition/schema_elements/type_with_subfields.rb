        #   one of {BuiltInTypes ElasticGraph's built-in types} or a type that has been defined in your schema.

        #   artifacts (`json_schemas.yaml` and `datastore_config.yaml`). This can be used along with `name_in_index` to support careful
        #   schema evolution.
        # @param indexing_only [Boolean] if `true`, ElasticGraph will define the field for indexing (in the `json_schemas.yaml` and
        #   `datastore_config.yaml` schema artifact) but will omit it from the GraphQL schema. This can be useful to begin indexing a field
        #   before you expose it in GraphQL so that you can fully backfill it first.

        #   differently named field in the index.
        # @option options [String] singular can be used on a list field (e.g. `t.field "tags", "[String!]!", singular: "tag"`) to tell
        #   ElasticGraph what the singular form of a field's name is. When provided, ElasticGraph will define a `groupedBy` field (using the

        # @see #relates_to_one
        #
        # @note Be careful about defining non-nullable fields. Changing a field’s type from non-nullable (e.g. `Int!`) to nullable (e.g.
        #   `Int`) is a breaking change for clients. Making a field non-nullable may also prevent you from applying permissioning to a field
        #   via an AuthZ layer (as such a layer would have no way to force a field value to `null` when for a client denied field access).
        #   Therefore, we recommend limiting your use of `!` to only a few situations such as defining a type’s primary key (e.g.
        #   `t.field "id", "ID!"`) or defining a list field (e.g. `t.field "authors", "[String!]!"`) since empty lists already provide a
        #   "no data" representation. You can still configure the ElasticGraph indexer to require a non-null value for a field using
        #   `f.json_schema nullable: false`.
        #
        # @note ElasticGraph’s understanding of datastore capabilities may override your configured
        #   `aggregatable`/`filterable`/`groupable`/`sortable` options. For example, a field indexed as `text` for full text search will
        #   not be sortable or groupable even if you pass `sortable: true, groupable: true` when defining the field, because [text fields
        #   cannot be efficiently sorted by or grouped on](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/text.html#text).
        #
        # @example Define a field with documentation
        #   ElasticGraph.define_schema do |schema|
        #     schema.object_type "Campaign" do |t|

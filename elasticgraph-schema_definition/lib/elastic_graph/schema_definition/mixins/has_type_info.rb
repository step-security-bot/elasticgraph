      #
      # - {SchemaElements::ScalarType}: allows specification of how scalars are represented in JSON schema and the index.
      # - {SchemaElements::TypeWithSubfields}: allows customization of how an object type is represented in JSON schema and the index.
      # - {SchemaElements::Field}: allows customization of a specific field over the field type's standard JSON schema and the index mapping.

        #
        # On a {SchemaElements::Field}, this can be used to customize how a field is indexed. For example, `String` fields are normally

        # field for full text search, you’d need to configure `mapping type: "text"`.

        # modeled as an object in GraphQL. For example, we use it for the `GeoLocation` type so they get indexed in Elasticsearch using the

        # validate events before indexing their data in the datastore. In addition, the publisher may use `json_schemas.yaml` for code
        # generation and to apply validation before publishing an event to ElasticGraph.

        #
        # This is _required_ on a {SchemaElements::ScalarType} (since we don’t know how a custom scalar type should be represented in
        # JSON!). On a {SchemaElements::Field}, this is optional, but can be used to make the JSON schema validation stricter then it
        # would otherwise be. For example, you could use `json_schema maxLength: 30` on a `String` field to limit the length.
        #
        # You can use any of the JSON schema validation keywords here. In addition, `nullable: false` is supported to configure the
        # generated JSON schema to disallow `null` values for the field. Note that if you define a field with a non-nullable GraphQL type
        # (e.g. `Int!`), the JSON schema will automatically disallow nulls. However, as explained in the
        # {SchemaElements::TypeWithSubfields#field} documentation, we generally recommend against defining non-nullable GraphQL fields.
        # `json_schema nullable: false` will disallow `null` values from being indexed, while still keeping the field nullable in the
        # GraphQL schema. If you think you might want to make a field non-nullable in the GraphQL schema some day, it’s a good idea to use
        # `json_schema nullable: false` now to ensure every indexed record has a non-null value for the field.
        #
        # @note We recommend using JSON schema validations in a limited fashion. Validations that are appropriate to apply when data is
        #   entering the system-of-record are often not appropriate on a secondary index like ElasticGraph. Events that violate a JSON
        #   schema validation will fail to index (typically they will be sent to the dead letter queue and page an oncall engineer). If an
        #   ElasticGraph instance is meant to contain all the data of some source system, you probably don’t want it applying stricter
        #   validations than the source system itself has. We recommend limiting your JSON schema validations to situations where
        #   violations would prevent ElasticGraph from operating correctly.

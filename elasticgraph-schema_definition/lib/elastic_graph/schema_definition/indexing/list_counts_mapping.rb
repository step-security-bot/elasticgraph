              #   individual documents to have any list fields with more elements than can fit in an integer.
              # - Using `long` would allow for much larger counts, but we don't want to take up double the
              #   storage space for this.

              # Note that `new_list_filter_input_type` (in `schema_definition/factory.rb`) relies on this, and
              # has chosen to use `IntFilterInput` (rather than `JsonSafeLongFilterInput`) for filtering these count values.

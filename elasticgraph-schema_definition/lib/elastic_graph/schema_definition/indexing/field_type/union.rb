            # Note: Although both "oneOf" and "anyOf" keywords are valid for combining schemas
            # to form a union, and validate equivalently when no object can satisfy multiple of the
            # subschemas (which is the case here given the __typename requirements are mutually
            # exclusive), we chose to use "oneOf" here because it works better with this library:

            # Since an enum type already restricts the values to a small set of allowed values, we do not need to keep
            # other customizations (such as the `maxLength` field customization EG automatically applies to fields
            # indexed as a `keyword`--we don't allow enum values to exceed that length, anyway).
            #
            # It's desirable to restrict what customizations are applied because when a publisher uses the JSON schema
            # to generate code using a library such as https://github.com/pwall567/json-kotlin-schema-codegen, we found
            # that the presence of extra field customizations inhibits the library's ability to generate code in the way
            # we want (it causes the type of the enum to change since the JSON schema changes from a direct `$ref` to
            # being wrapped in an `allOf`).
            #
            # However, we still want to apply `enum` customizations--this allows a user to "narrow" the set of allowed
            # values for a field. For example, a `Currency` enum could contain every currency, and a user may want to
            # restrict a specific `currency` field to a subset of currencies (e.g. to just USD, CAD, and EUR).
            customizations.slice("enum")

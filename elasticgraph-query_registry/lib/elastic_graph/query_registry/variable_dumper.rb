module ElasticGraph
  module QueryRegistry
    # Responsible for dumping structural information about query variables.
    #
    # This is necessary for the query registry to be able to support object and enum variables.
    # To understand why, consider what happens when a field is removed from an input object
    # variable used by a client's query. Whether or not it that will break the client depends
    # on which fields of the input object the client populates when sending the query to
    # ElasticGraph. Similarly, if an enum value is removed from an enum value variable used by
    # a client, it could be a breaking change (but only if the client ever passes the removed
    # enum value).
    #
    # To detect this situation, we use this to dump the structural information about all variables.
    # When the structure of variables changes, we can then tell the engineer that they need to verify
    # that it won't break the client.

module ElasticGraph
  module QueryRegistry
    # An abstraction that implements a registry of GraphQL queries. Callers should use
    # `build_and_validate_query` to get `GraphQL::Query` objects so that clients are properly
    # limited in what queries we execute on their behalf.
    #
    # Note that this class is designed to be as efficient as possible:
    #
    # - Registered GraphQL queries are only parsed once, and then the parsed form is used
    #   each time that query is submitted. In our benchmarking, parsing of large queries
    #   can be significant, taking ~10ms or so.
    # - We delay parsing a registered client's queries until the first time that client
    #   sends us a query. That way, we don't have to pay any parsing cost for queries
    #   that were registered by an old client that no longer sends us requests.
    # - Likewise, we defer reading a client's registered query strings off of disk until
    #   the first time it submits a request.
    #
    # In addition, it's worth noting that we support some basic "fuzzy" matching of query
    # strings, based on the query canonicalization performed by the GraphQL gem. Semantically
    # insignificant changes to the query string from a registered query (such as whitespace
    # differences, or comments) are tolerated.
    class Registry
      # Public factory method, which builds a `Registry` instance from the given directory.
      # Subdirectories are treated as client names, and the files in them are treated as
      # individually registered queries.
      def self.build_from_directory(schema, directory, allow_unregistered_clients:, allow_any_query_for_clients:)
        directory = Pathname.new(directory)

      # Builds a `GraphQL::Query` object for the given query string, and validates that it is
      # an allowed query. Returns a list of registry validation errors in addition to the built
      # query object. The list of validation errors will be empty if the query should be allowed.
      # A query can be allowed either by virtue of being registered for usage by the given clent,
      # or by being for a completely unregistered client (if `allow_unregistered_clients` is `true`).
      #
      # This is also tolerant of some minimal differences in the query string (such as comments
      # and whitespace). If the query differs in a significant way from a registered query, it
      # will not be recognized as registered.

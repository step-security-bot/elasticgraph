    # Decorator that wraps a datastore client in order to implement dry run behavior.
    # All write operations are implemented as no-ops, while read operations are passed through
    # to the wrapped datastore client.
    #
    # We prefer this over having to check a `dry_run` flag in many places because that's
    # easy to forget. One mistake and a dry run isn't truly a dry run!
    #
    # In contrast, this gives us a strong guarantee that dry run mode truly avoids mutating
    # any datastore state. This decorator specifically picks and chooses which operations it
    # allows.
    #
    # - Read operations are forwarded to the wrapped datastore client.
    # - Write operations are implemented as no-ops.
    #
    # If/when the calling code evolves to call a new method on this, it'll trigger
    # `NoMethodError`, giving us a good chance to evaluate how this decorator should
    # support a particular API. This is also why this doesn't use Ruby's `delegate` library,
    # because we don't want methods automatically delegated; we want to opt-in to only the read-only methods.

        # and the state of the index in the datastore, does one of the following:
        #
        #   - If the index did not already exist: creates the index with the desired mappings and settings.
        #   - If the desired mapping has fewer fields than what is in the index: raises an exception,
        #     because the datastore provides no way to remove fields from a mapping and it would be confusing
        #     for this method to silently ignore the issue.
        #   - If the settings have desired changes: updates the settings, restoring any setting that
        #     no longer has a desired value to its default.
        #   - If the mapping has desired changes: updates the mappings.

        #
        #   - If the index did not already exist: creates the index with the desired mappings and settings.
        #   - If the desired mapping has fewer fields than what is in the index: raises an exception,

        # us not dropping old unused fields. The datastore doesn't allow it on indices, anyway (though it does allow

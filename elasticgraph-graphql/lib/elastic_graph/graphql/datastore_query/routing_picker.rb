        # without risking missing any matching documents that could exist on other shards.
        #
        # If an eligible list of routing values cannot be determined, returns `nil`.
        #
        # Importantly, we have to be careful to not return routing values unless we are 100% sure
        # that the set of values will route to the full set of shards on which documents matching
        # the filters could live. If a document matching the filters lived on a shard that our
        # search does not route to, it will not be included in the search response.

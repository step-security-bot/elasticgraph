      # A generic pagination implementation, designed to handle both document pagination and
      # aggregation pagination. Not tested directly; tests drive the `Query` interface instead.
      #
      # Our pagination support is designed to support Facebook's Relay Cursor Connections Spec.
      # The description of the pagination algorithm is directly implemented by this class:
      #
      #    https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm#sec-Pagination-algorithm
      #
      # As described by the spec, we support 4 pagination arguments, and apply them in this order:
      #
      #   - `after`: items with a cursor value on or before this value are excluded
      #   - `before`: items with a cursor value on or after this value are excluded
      #   - `first`: after applying before/after, all but the first `N` items are excluded
      #   - `last`: after applying before/after/first, all but the last `N` items are excluded
      #
      # Note that `first` is applied before `last`, meaning that when both are provided (as in
      # `first: 10, last: 4`) it is interpreted as "the last 4 of the first 10". However, the Relay
      # spec itself discourages clients from passing both, but servers must still support it:
      #
      # > Including a value for both first and last is strongly discouraged, as it is likely to lead
      # > to confusing queries and results.
      #
      # For document pagination, the relay semantics are implemented on top of Elasticsearch/OpenSearch's `search_after` feature:
      #
      #    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-search-after.html
      #
      # For aggregation pagination, the relay semantics are implemented on top of the composite aggregation
      # pagination feature:
      #
      #    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.12/search-aggregations-bucket-composite-aggregation.html#_pagination
      #
      # In either case, the `search_after` (or `after`) argument is directly analogous to Relay's `after`.
      # To support the full Relay spec, we have to do some additional clever things:
      #
      #   - When necessary (such as for `last: 50, before: some_cursor`), we have to _reverse_ the
      #     sort, perform the query with a size of `last`, and then reverse the returned items
      #     to the originally requested order.
      #   - In some cases, we have to apply `after`, `before` or `last` as a post-processing step
      #     to the items returned by the datastore.
      #
      # Note, however, that the sort key data type used for these two cases is a bit different:
      #
      # - For document pagination, `search_after` is a list of scalar values, corresponding to the order
      #   of `sort` clauses. That is, if we are sorting on `amount` ascending and `createdAt` descending,
      #   then the `search_after` value (and the `sort` value of each document) will be an
      #   `[amount, createdAt]` tuple.
      # - For aggregation pagination, `after` (and the `key` of each aggregation bucket is an unordered
      #   hash of sort values. The sort field order is instead implied by the composite aggregation
      #   `sources`.

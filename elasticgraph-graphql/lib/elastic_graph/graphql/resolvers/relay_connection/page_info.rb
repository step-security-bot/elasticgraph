        # Provides the `PageInfo` field values required by the relay spec.
        #
        # The relay connections spec defines an algorithm behind `hasPreviousPage` and `hasNextPage`:
        # https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm#sec-undefined.PageInfo.Fields
        #
        # However, it has a couple bugs as currently written (https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/2787),
        # so we have implemented our own algorithm instead. It would be nice to calculate `hasPreviousPage`
        # and `hasNextPage` on-demand in a resolver, so we do not spend any effort on it if the client has
        # not requested those fields, but it is quite hard to calculate them after the fact: we need to know
        # whether we removed any leading or trailing items while processing the list to accurately answer
        # the question, "do we have a page before or after the one we are returning?".
        #
        # Note: it's not clear what values `hasPreviousPage` and `hasNextPage` should have when we are returning
        # a blank page (the client isn't being returned any cursors to continue paginating from!). This logic,
        # as written, will normally cause both fields to be `true` (our request of `size: size + 1` will get us
        # a list of 1 document, which will then be removed, causing `items.first` and `items.last` to
        # both change to `nil`). However, if the datastore returns an empty list to us than `false` will be returned
        # for one or both fields, based on the presence or absence of the `before`/`after` cursors in the pagination
        # arguments. Regardless, given that it's not clear what the correct value is, we are just doing the
        # least-effort thing and not putting any special handling for this case in place.

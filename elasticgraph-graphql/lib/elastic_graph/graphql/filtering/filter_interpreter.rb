          # a nested bool node instead of on the `bool_node` we are already operating on.
          #
          # To understand why, first consider a filter that has no `any_of` but does use field nesting:
          #
          # filter: {
          #   weight: {lt: 2000},
          #   cost: {
          #     currency: {equal_to_any_of: ["USD"]}
          #     amount: {gt: 1000}
          #   }
          # }
          #
          # While this `currency` and `amount` are expressed as sub-filters under `cost` in our GraphQL
          # syntax, we do not actually need to create a nested bool node structure for the datastore
          # query. We get a flat filter structure like this:
          #
          # {bool: {filter: [
          #   {range: {"weight": {lt: 2000}}},
          #   {terms: {"cost.currency": ["USD"]}},
          #   {range: {"amount": {gt: 1000}}}
          # ]}}
          #
          # The 3 filter conditions are ANDed together as a single list under `filter`.
          # The nested field structure gets flattened using a dot-separated path.
          #
          # Now consider a filter that has multiple `any_of` sub-expressions:
          #
          # filter: {
          #   weight: {any_of: [
          #     {gt: 9000},
          #     {lt: 2000}
          #   ]},
          #   cost: {any_of: [
          #     currency: {equal_to_any_of: ["USD"]},
          #     amount: {gt: 1000}
          #   ]}
          # }
          #
          # If we did not make a nested structure, we would wind up with a single list of sub-expressions
          # that are OR'd together:
          #
          # {bool: {filter: [{bool: {should: [
          #   {range: {"weight": {gt: 9000}}},
          #   {range: {"weight": {lt: 2000}}},
          #   {terms: {"cost.currency": ["USD"]}},
          #   {range: {"amount": {gt: 1000}}}
          # ]}}]}}
          #
          # ...but that's clearly wrong. By creating a nested bool node based on the presence of `any_of`,
          # we can instead produce a structure like this:
          #
          # {bool: {filter: [
          #   {bool: {should: [
          #     {range: {"weight": {gt: 9000}}},
          #     {range: {"weight": {lt: 2000}}}
          #   ]}},
          #   {bool: {should: [
          #     {terms: {"cost.currency": ["USD"]}},
          #     {range: {"amount": {gt: 1000}}}
          #   ]}}
          # ]}}

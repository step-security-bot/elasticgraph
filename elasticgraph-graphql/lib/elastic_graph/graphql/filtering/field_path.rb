        # but they'll be different when we encounter a list field indexed using the `nested` mapping type.
        # When we're traversing a subfield of a `nested` field, `from_root` will contain the full path from
        # the original, overall document root, while `from_parent` will contain the path from the current
        # nested document's root.

        # Converts the current paths to what they need to be to be able to query our hidden `__counts` field (which
        # is a map containing the counts of elements of every list field on the document). The `__counts` field
        # sits a the root of every document (for both an overall root document and a `nested` document). Here's an
        # example (which assumes `seasons` and `seasons.players` fields which are both `nested` and an `awards` field
        # which is a list of strings). Given a filter like this:
        #
        # filter: {seasons: {any_satisfy: {players: {any_satisfy: {results: {awards: {count: {gt: 1}}}}}}}}
        #
        # ...after processing the `awards` key, our `FieldPath` will be:
        #
        # FieldPath.new(["seasons", "players", "results", "awards"], ["results", "awards"])
        #
        # When we then reach the `count` sub field and `counts_path` is called on it, the following will be returned:
        #
        # FieldPath.new(["seasons", "players", LIST_COUNTS_FIELD, "results|awards"], [LIST_COUNTS_FIELD, "results|awards"])
        #
        # This gives us what we want:
        # - The path from the root is `seasons.players.__counts.results|awards`.
        # - The path from the (nested) parent is `__counts.results|awards`.
        #
        # Note that our `__counts` field is a flat map which uses `|` (the `LIST_COUNTS_FIELD_PATH_KEY_SEPARATOR` character)
        # to separate its parts (hence, it's `results|awards` instead of `results.awards`).
        def counts_path
          from_root_to_parent_of_counts_field = from_root[0...-from_parent.size] # : ::Array[::String]
          counts_sub_field = [LIST_COUNTS_FIELD, from_parent.join(LIST_COUNTS_FIELD_PATH_KEY_SEPARATOR)]

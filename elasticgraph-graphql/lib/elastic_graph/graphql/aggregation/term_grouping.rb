        # This specific exception message was introduced in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/89993, but that was done to provide
        # a better error than a NullPointerException (which is what used to happen). This error also appears to be non-deterministic; I wasn't
        # able to reproduce the CI failure locally until I forced `"collect_mode" => "breadth_first"`, at which point I did see the same error
        # locally. The Elasticsearch docs[^1] mention that a heuristic (partially based on if a field's cardinality is known!) is used to pick
        # whether `breadth_first` or `depth_first` is used when `collect_mode`is not specified:
        #
        # > The `breadth_first` is the default mode for fields with a cardinality bigger than the requested size or when the cardinality is unknown
        # > (numeric fields or scripts for instance).
        #
        # In addition, the docs[^2] make it clear that `depth_first` is usually what you want:
        #
        # > The strategy we outlined previously—building the tree fully and then pruning—is called depth-first and it is the default.
        # > Depth-first works well for the majority of aggregations, but can fall apart in situations like our actors and costars example.
        # >
        # > ...
        # >
        # > Breadth-first should be used only when you expect more buckets to be generated than documents landing in the buckets.
        #
        # So, for now we are forcing the collect mode to `depth_first`, as it avoids an issue with Elasticsearch and is a generally
        # sane default. It may fall over in the case breadth-first is intended for, but we can cross that bridge when it comes.
        #
        # Long term, we're hoping to switch sub-aggregations to use a `composite` aggregation instead of `terms`, rendering this moot.

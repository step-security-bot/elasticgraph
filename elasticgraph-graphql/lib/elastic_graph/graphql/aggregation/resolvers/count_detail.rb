        # Resolves the detailed `count` sub-fields of a sub-aggregation. It's an object because

        # fields we expose to give the client control over how much detail they want.
        #
        # Note: for now our resolver logic only uses the bucket fields returned to us by the datastore,
        # but I believe we may have some opportunities to provide more accurate responses to these when custom shard
        # routing and/or index rollover are in use. For example, when grouping on the custom shard routing field,
        # we know that no term bucket will have data from more than one shard. The datastore isn't aware of our
        # custom shard routing logic, though, and can't account for that in what it returns, so it may indicate
        # a potential error upper bound where we can deduce there is none.

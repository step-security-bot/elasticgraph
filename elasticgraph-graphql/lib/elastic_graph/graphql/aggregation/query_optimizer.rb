  class GraphQL
    module Aggregation
      # This class is used by `DatastoreQuery.perform` to optimize away an inefficiency that's present in
      # our aggregations API. To explain what this does, it's useful to see an example:
      #
      # ```
      # query WigdetsBySizeAndColor($filter: WidgetFilterInput) {
      #   by_size: widgetAggregations(filter: $filter) {
      #     edges { node {
      #       size
      #       count
      #     } }
      #   }
      #
      #   by_color: widgetAggregations(filter: $filter) {
      #     edges { node {
      #       color
      #       count
      #     } }
      #   }
      # }
      # ```
      #
      # With this API, two separate datastore queries get built--one for `by_size`, and one
      # for `by_color`. While we're able to send them to the datastore in a single `msearch` request,
      # as it allows a single search to have multiple aggregations in it. The aggregations
      # API we offered before April 2023 directly supported this, allowing for more efficient
      # queries. (But it had other significant downsides).
      #
      # We found that sending 2 queries is significantly slower than sending one combined query
      # (from benchmarks/aggregations_old_vs_new_api.rb):
      #
      # Benchmarks for old API (300 times):
      # Average took value: 15
      # Median took value: 14
      # P99 took value: 45
      #
      # Benchmarks for new API (300 times):
      # Average took value: 28
      # Median took value: 25
      # P99 took value: 75
      #
      # This class optimizes this case by merging `DatastoreQuery` objects together when we can safely do so,
      # in order to execute fewer datastore queries. Notably, while this was designed for this specific
      # aggregations case, the merging logic can also apply in non-aggregations case.
      #
      # Note that we want to err on the side of safety here. We only merge queries if their datastore
      # payloads are byte-for-byte identical when aggregations are excluded. There are some cases where
      # we _could_ merge slightly differing queries in clever ways (for example, if the only difference is
      # `track_total_hits: false` vs `track_total_hits: true`, we could merge to a single query with
      # `track_total_hits: true`), but that's significantly more complex and error prone, so we do not do it.
      # We can always improve this further in the future to cover more cases.
      #
      # NOTE: the `QueryOptimizer` assumes that `Aggregation::Query` will always produce aggregation keys
      # using `Aggregation::Query#name` such that `Aggregation::Key.extract_aggregation_name_from` is able
      # to extract the original name from response keys. If that is violated, it will not work properly and
      # subtle bugs can result. However, we have a test helper method which is hooked into our unit and
      # integration tests for `DatastoreQuery` (`verify_aggregations_satisfy_optimizer_requirements`) which
      # verifies that this requirement is satisfied.

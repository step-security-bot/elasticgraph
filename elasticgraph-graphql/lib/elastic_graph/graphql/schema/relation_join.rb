  class GraphQL
    class Schema
      # Represents the join between documents for a relation.
      #
      # Note that this class assumes a valid, well-formed schema definition, and makes no
      # attempt to provide user-friendly errors when that is not the case. For example,
      # we assume that a nested relationship field has at most one relationship directive.
      # The (as yet unwritten) schema linter should validate such things eventually.
      # When we do encounter errors at runtime (such as getting a scalar where we expect
      # a list, or vice-versa), this class attempts to deal with as best as it can (sometimes
      # simply picking one record or id from many!) and logs a warning.
      #
      # Note: this class isn't driven directly by tests. It exist purely to serve the needs
      # of ElasticGraph::Resolvers::NestedRelationships, and is driven by that class's tests.
      # It lives here because it's useful to expose it off of a `Field` since it's a property
      # of the field and that lets us memoize it on the field itself.

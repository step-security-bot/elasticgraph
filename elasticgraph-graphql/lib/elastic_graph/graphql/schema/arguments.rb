module ElasticGraph
  class GraphQL
    class Schema
      # A utility module for working with GraphQL schema arguments.
      module Arguments
        # A utility method to convert the given `args_hash` to its schema form.
        # The schema form is the casing of the arguments according to the GraphQL
        # schema definition.  For example, consider a case like:
        #
        # type Query {
        #   widgets(orderBy: [WidgetSort!]): [Widget!]!
        # }
        #
        # The GraphQL gem converts all arguments to ruby keyword args style (symbolized,
        # snake_case keys) before passing the args to us, but the `orderBy` argument in
        # the schema definition uses camelCase. ElasticGraph was designed to flexibly
        # support whatever casing the schema developer chooses to use but the GraphQL
        # gem's conversion to keyword args style gets in the way. ElasticGraph needs to
        # receive the arguments in the casing form defined in the schema so that, for example,
        # when it creates a datastore query, it correctly filters on fields according
        # to the casing of the fields in the index.
        #
        # This utility method converts an args hash back to its schema form (string keys,
        # with the casing from the schema) by using the arg definitions themselves to get
        # the arg names from the GraphQL schema.
        #
        # Example:
        #
        #   to_schema_form({ order_by: ["size"] }, widgets_field)
        #     # => { "orderBy" => ["size"] }
        #
        # The implementation here was taken from a code snippet provided by the maintainer of
        # the GraphQL gem: https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues/2869

                # outside of this loop, to give us an O(1) lookup here. However,
                # usually there are a small number of args (e.g 1 or 2, maybe up
                # to 6 in extreme cases) so it's probably likely to be ultimately
                # slower to build the hash, particularly when you account for the
                # extra memory allocation and GC for the hash.

# ElasticGraph::Rack

Uses [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack) to serve an ElasticGraph application.
Intended primarily to make it easy to boot ElasticGraph applications locally,
but could also be used to serve an ElasticGraph application from any Rack
compatible web server.

## Serving an ElasticGraph GraphQL Endpoint

`ElasticGraph::Rack::GraphQLEndpoint` is a Rack application. Here's an
example of using it in a Rack `config.ru` file:

```ruby
require 'elastic_graph/graphql'
require 'elastic_graph/rack/graphql_endpoint'

graphql = ElasticGraph::GraphQL.from_yaml_file("path/to/config.yaml")
run ElasticGraph::Rack::GraphQLEndpoint.new(graphql)
```

Run this with `rackup` (after installing the `rackup` gem) or any other rack-compatible server.

## Serving a GraphiQL UI

This gem also provides a simple GraphiQL UI using the CDN-hosted GraphiQL assets.
Here's an example `config.ru` to boot that:

``` ruby
require 'elastic_graph/graphql'
require 'elastic_graph/rack/graphiql'

graphql = ElasticGraph::GraphQL.from_yaml_file("path/to/config.yaml")
run ElasticGraph::Rack::GraphiQL.new(graphql)
```

Run this with `rackup` (after installing the `rackup` gem) or any other rack-compatible server.
